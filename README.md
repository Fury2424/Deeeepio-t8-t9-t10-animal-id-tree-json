# Deeeepio-t8-t9-t10-animal-id-tree-json
Okay so I am sure this data probably exists somewhere else, but I didn't look for it and created it myself. ,_,

In case a like-minded person needed a JSON file full of the EVO tree including tier 8 to tier 10, I decided to post it.

The dataset doesn't include piranha.

Also, any errors will be fixed (eventually) but please let me know if you notice anything and make a correction.
